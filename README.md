# Sima's Recipes
## Practical Python and Data-Centric Development Milestone Project

I have chosen to create a cook book from project ideas suggested by Code Institute to test myself, that would I be able to fullfill all the requirements as requested and test my knowledge from previous two modules. Also, I am not a good cook, but with this cookbook I might be able to ask my friends and family to add some recipes which I can try and learn some yummy recipes and keep record of it rather than flipping cookery book pages or searching online.

My idea is to keep design simple using well known website template, which help user(s) or customer(s) navigate through website easily with confident. Also, I have kept in mind that having website full of content and loads of information on single page will make it look tawdry. My intention is to have simple yet information rich webpages with modern and attractive design.

## UX

This project is for those people who like to have their recipes on one place and can be able to find them easily as and when they like to cook something. Also, for those users who is learning from their friends and family but not able to get hold them as and when they need help with recipe they like to cook.

For Example: If I would like to cook Chicken Madras curry over the weekend with help of my friend who is ot available on that perticular day. I can ask my friend to add that recipe into my cook book as when ahe have sometime before weekend. That is how I can cook Chicken Madras curry with help of my friend without disturbing her weekend plan. Once I get recipe in my cookbook and having admin authority I can place that recipe in perticular category or place where ismost suitable and easier for me to find in future.
